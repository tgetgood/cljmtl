# Grand Theft Wumpus

We're going to go through chapter 8 of Conrad Barski's wonderful and eccentric
Land of Lisp.

The code from the book is available [here](http://landoflisp.com/wumpus.lisp),
but we're going to reimplement it --- In real time and under pressure --- so
don't look.

## Plot

You (the Lisp alien) and the Wumpus are partners in crime. You've just come to
Congestion City to make your fortune. But after your first job, knocking off a
liquor store, the Wumpus betrays you, takes the getaway car and the money, and
leaves you high and dry.

You've got to catch the Wumpus and get that money, or you're as good as dead.

The good news is that you managed to wound the Wumpus as he drove off, but the
bad news is that now you have only one bullet left. When you find hum, you'll
need to charge in guns blazing (very briefly) or you're in trouble.

You don't know your way around the city, the cops have set up roadblocks at
random, and worse yet, there's a rival gang in town (the Glowworms) that doesn't
like competiton. At least they glow.
